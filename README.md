This project will allow you to program in the Motoko programming language, without the need to write a single line of code!
By having control of the code of the "Canisters" with blocks, it will allow better maintenance of the programs, creating a better experience when creating them, even for those who start programming.
At the end of the program, you can give us the code in Motoko, thus being able to understand how this language works, giving us the opportunity to display our canisters with the code you generate.
